# SwiftTwitterAuthDemo

A simple Swift app used to demonstrate two different ways of doing a multi-step Twitter auth flow.

One way is using conventional completion blocks. But this basically gets you into callback hell lickety split.
The other way is using ReactiveCocoa (note: the work-in-progress Swift version)
